## My last week

Last week was busy and varied, filled with studying, personal moments, and active relaxation.

At the beginning of the week, I decided to dedicate some time to my health and mental balance by doing yoga in the park. The fresh morning air, birds singing, and a gentle breeze created the perfect atmosphere for meditation and stretching. These sessions helped me get into a positive mindset and recharge my energy for the day.

At the same time, I started actively preparing for my upcoming finals. Studying required serious focus, especially for challenging subjects like linear algebra and calculus. Midweek, I had a test in linear algebra, which turned out to be quite difficult, but I felt that I managed it fairly well.

Besides studying, I also found time for my personal life — I went on a date. It was a pleasant evening that helped me take a break from the intense schedule and boost my mood.

At the end of the week, I had a calculus test, which I passed with a score of 6 out of 10. Although the result wasn’t perfect, it was a good sign that I’m on the right track and can improve my understanding.
